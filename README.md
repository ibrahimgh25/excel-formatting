# Excel Formatting Library

A piece of code to help format excel files when saving.

## Why this exists
Five years ago, I built a web scraper that organized articles for easier searching and analysis. When I delivered an Excel file to my boss, he criticized the formatting. I was surprisedâ€”the data was there, why care about format? To address this, I created a module that I've dragged with me for every excel task. Never received formatting complaints again.

Recently, I dusted off this module for a file-merging task. It still worked but looked ugly, so I decided to refactor it.
